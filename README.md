- ðŸš— Just finished a project where I built an **Autonomous RC Car!!** I learned about control systems, data processing, and electronic hardware work. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/RaghavS06/autonomous-rc-car) for more info!

## Latest Project...
- âš› **QUANTUM CIRCUIT SIMULATION** âš› I've recently been interested in learning about quantum mechanics and I thought building this app would be a fun way to understand the fundamental math and concepts behind quantum systems! The app is fully interactive for you to use, and more info and the code is available [here](https://github.com/RaghavS06/interactive-quantum-simulator)!
